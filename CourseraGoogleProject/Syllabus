About this Course
This is a self-paced lab that takes place in the Google Cloud console. In this lab, you learn the basic ‘Hello World' of machine learning. Instead of programming explicit rules in a language such as Java or C++, you build a system that is trained on data to infer the rules that determine a relationship between numbers.
