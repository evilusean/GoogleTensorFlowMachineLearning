Wanted to understand what all the hype about AI/ChatGPT was about, so did this free 10+ hour course.

Very Mathy, will need more linear algebra/calculus/trig to fully understand: </br>
instantaneous rate of change: smaller interval = more accurate </br>
Derivatives: lim 0 Vs L = (f(a+h) -f(a))/h </br>
Chain Rule: h(x) = f(g(x))g(x) Vs dz/dx = (dz/dy)*(dy/dx) </br>
  If a car is twice as fast as a bibcycle and a bicycle is four times as fast as a man, the car will be 8x as fast as a man. </br>
slope intercept: Y=m(x) + b </br>
hyperbolic functions:(tanh) </br>
Topological Sort: ordering of graphs, such that all the edges go only from left to right</br>
maximum liklihood assigned/log probability=log(a*b*c) = log(a) + log(b) + log(c)</br>
